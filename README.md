# GIR-Puppet
Arduino Code for GIR Puppet
Includes one button library to change RGB LED from red to blue. Hold the botton down for three seconds to turn off the LEDs. 
Note: the LEDs used for this project were common cathode

Includes DF Player Mini to play up to ten GIR sound files. I have included a few edited GIR sounds from the show. I do not own the rights to the sound files. I am using this as personal use and I suggest you do the same. Each sound file can be played using a certain button. This is sort of like a sound board .
For the DF Player mini, make sure to have your sound files saved in the folder titled "mp3"
Each of the sound files you use must start with the numbering system 000-???. See the included mp3 file for reference.

For wiring, please refer to the code. The board used is a Arduino Uno.
